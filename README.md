# BeepMachine

A student in the pyschology program asked me to create a machine that would beep once every two seconds. This behavior would repeat for a grand total of 38 beeps. 

Very simple code using the built-in libraries. Really Easy and fun.

*This program makes use of 3 functions*

`delay` makes the arduino wait 
`noTone` makes the arduino cease emitting the tone
`tone` lets you specify which digital pin the tone will be sent out of and what frequency the tone will be
